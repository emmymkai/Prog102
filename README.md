AI in Game Design:
  Choose a way algorithms are used in a dicipline or potentioal career path, address the issue from both the consumer and developer perspective. Create an interactive project to convey the information.

  The way I chose to solve the challenge was by evaluating how AI effects game development.

  There is information regarding how AI is currently being used in sound design, sprites, coding, and story writing. There is also information for the perspective of the players in terms of concerns and possible benefits.  Its interactable to a degree as you can click on the perspective of either the player or developer and then click through all the areas it is used in and what the concerns are.
