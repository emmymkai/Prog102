**AI in Game Design:**
  Choose a way algorithms are used in a dicipline or potentioal career path, address the issue from both the consumer and developer perspective. Create an interactive project to convey the information.

  The way I chose to solve the challenge was by evaluating how AI effects game development.

  There is information regarding how AI is currently being used in sound design, sprites, coding, and story writing. There is also information for the perspective of the players in terms of concerns and possible benefits.  Its interactable to a degree as you can click on the perspective of either the player or developer and then click through all the areas it is used in and what the concerns are. 

**Data, Information, and Knowledge:**
  Use JavaScript to create a project that uses data, information, and knowledge.

  The project demonstrates the 3 ideas of data, information, and knowledge by taking raw data, using a class to store the data. From then turning it into information with a function that puts it into context and then turns it into knowledge by having different text depending on the salary amount. 

**Interactive Work (Global, Political, or Societal Relevance):**
  Create an interactive work (global, political, or societal relevance) on an issue. The default option is to create a website using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

  I chose to do my project about healthcare not being affordable for most young adults. The target audience is young adults ages 18-30 who work gig, part-time, freelance, or service industry jobs and do not receive employer sponsored health insurance. This ground often includes rideshare drivers, food delivery workers, retail employees, baristas, artists, recent college graduates, and people juggling multiple part-time jobs. Many of these young adults live paycheck to paycheck, rely heavily on their phone for information, and often prioritize immediate financial needs (such as rent, food, transportation) over long term health planning. They are also among the most likely to be uninsured at some point during the year, worried about medical bills, delaying/skipping care due to cost, or unaware of affordable coverage options.

  The project was completeted as a website format with multiple interactable sections, even with a quiz toward the end to demonstrate how likely people are to be in need of help regarding health care. 

**Circuit Simulation:**
  Following lessons on tinkercad to make simulations of circuits.

  This software allows you to make circuits by connecting various types of technology models.
